# Week 1: Python Standard Libraries (up to 2 weeks)

## Goal:

To master Python's standard libraries, which are essential for a Python developer. This plan assumes you already know Python basics (files, exceptions, etc.) and focuses on practical usage of key libraries.

---

### 1. **`os` Module (1-2 Days)**

- **Goal:** Learn to work with the file system.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Write a script that recursively traverses a directory and lists all files with a specific extension (e.g., `.txt`).
  2. Create a script that copies all files from one directory to another, excluding files with a specific extension.
  3. Write a program that creates a backup of a specified directory by archiving it into a `.zip` file.

---

### 2. **`sys` Module (1 Day)**

- **Goal:** Understand how to work with command-line arguments and system parameters.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Write a script that takes command-line arguments and prints them in reverse order.
  2. Create a program that displays the Python version and the path to the Python interpreter.

---

### 3. **`datetime` Module (1-2 Days)**

- **Goal:** Learn to work with dates and times.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Write a script that calculates the difference in days between two dates.
  2. Create a program that displays the current time in different time zones.
  3. Write a script that generates a list of all Fridays that fall on the 13th of the month in a given year.

---

### 4. **`collections` Module (1-2 Days)**

- **Goal:** Use specialized data types like `defaultdict`, `Counter`, and `deque`.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Use `defaultdict` to count the frequency of words in a text.
  2. Create a program that uses `Counter` to find the most common elements in a list.
  3. Write a script that uses `deque` to implement a simple cache with a limited capacity.

---

### 5. **`itertools` Module (1-2 Days)**

- **Goal:** Master powerful tools for working with iterators.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Use `itertools.permutations` to generate all possible permutations of a list.
  2. Write a script that uses `itertools.groupby` to group elements of a list (name, age) by ages: 0-18, 19-30, 31-50, 51-70, 70+.
  3. Create a program that uses `itertools.cycle` to infinitely cycle through elements of a list.

---

### 6. **`re` Module (1-2 Days)**

- **Goal:** Learn to work with regular expressions.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Write a script that extracts all email addresses from a text.
  2. Create a program that checks if a string matches a phone number format.
  3. Write a script that replaces all occurrences of a specific word in a text with another word.

---

### 7. **`json` Module (1 Day)**

- **Goal:** Learn to work with JSON data.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Write a script that reads a JSON file and extracts specific data from it.
  2. Create a program that converts a Python dictionary to JSON and saves it to a file.

---

### 8. **`logging` Module (1 Day)**

- **Goal:** Set up and use logging effectively.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Write a script that logs messages of different levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) to a file.
  2. Create a program that uses logging to track the progress of a long-running operation.

## Recommendations:

- **Practice:** Complete all tasks to solidify your understanding of each library.
- **Documentation:** Refer to the official Python documentation for deeper insights into each library.
- **Projects:** Try integrating these libraries into small projects to see their real-world applications.
  By following this plan, you will gain a strong command of Python's standard libraries, which are crucial for becoming a proficient Python developer. Good luck!
