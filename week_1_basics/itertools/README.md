### 5. **`itertools` Module (2 Days)**

- **Goal:** Master powerful tools for working with iterators.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Use `itertools.permutations` to generate all possible permutations of a list.
  2. Write a script that uses `itertools.groupby` to group elements of a list (name, age) by ages: 0-18, 19-30, 31-50, 51-70, 70+.
  3. Create a program that uses `itertools.cycle` to infinitely cycle through elements of a list.
