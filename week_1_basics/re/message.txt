Tiuri has to spend his last night as squire, before he can become knight, in a chapel with his friends.
He is not allowed to speak or listen to the voices outside. In the middle of the night, a voice desperately whispers 
"Please, open the door!".' What would you do? I asked my students. Then they had to draw.
I drew a map of the Kingdom of Unauwen and next to it the Kingdom of Dagonaut, the countries through which Tiuri travels.
