# Python Backend Developer Roadmap (Weeks 4-7)

(approximate plan)

## Week 4: Advanced FastAPI & Architecture

**Focus:** Production-ready API patterns

- **Day 1-2:** 
  - Dependency injection (advanced use cases)
  - Custom middleware (logging, error handling)
  - Rate limiting
- **Day 3-4:**
  - Background tasks with Celery
  - Caching with Redis
  - WebSockets (real-time updates)
- **Day 5:**
  - Project: Add Redis cache to bookstore API
  - Implement WebSocket for new book notifications

## Week 5: System Design & Performance

**Focus:** Scalability patterns

- **Day 1:** 
  - Connection pooling (asyncpg/SQLAlchemy)
  - N+1 query problem solutions
- **Day 2:**
  - Database replication concepts
  - Read replicas in PostgreSQL
- **Day 3-4:**
  - Load testing with Locust
  - Optimizing FastAPI response times
- **Day 5:**
  - Project: Benchmark bookstore API
  - Implement pagination for large datasets

## Week 6: DevOps & Deployment

**Focus:** CI/CD and cloud deployment

- **Day 1-2:**
  - Docker containers (optimized FastAPI image)
  - Docker Compose (FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Redis)
- **Day 3:**
  - GitHub Actions for CI
  - Automated testing pipeline
- **Day 4-5:**
  - Deploy to AWS/GCP (free tier options)
  - Monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana
  - Project: Deploy bookstore with health checks

## Week 7: Microservices & Final Project

**Focus:** Distributed systems

- **Day 1-2:**
  - FastAPI microservice communication
  - Message queues (RabbitMQ)
  - Event-driven architecture
- **Day 3-4:**
  - API Gateway pattern
  - Service discovery
- **Day 5:**
  - Final Project:
    - Split bookstore into:
      1. User service (JWT auth)
      2. Inventory service
      3. Payment service
    - Connect via message queue
